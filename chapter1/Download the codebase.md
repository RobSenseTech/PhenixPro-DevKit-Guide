## 1.Download Source Code

Download code from github:

```
git clone https://github.com/RobSenseTech/PhenixPro_Devkit
```

compile code under the guidance of [prj_path]/README.md

**Note**: From now on, we have two branch on github:

master is the release branch, we only modify code on develop branch, and merge it to master after new code have been tested well.
